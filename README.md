# Simple Django Blog App

This is a simple blog app made using the Django framework with PostgreSQL database in use.

## Purpose

I developed this application solely for the purpose of learning Django. Please note that it is not fully polished and may contain bugs, such as issues with image loading, which I plan to resolve in the near future.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, ensure you have Python and Django installed. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Apply migrations:
`python manage.py migrate`

3. Run the development server:
`python manage.py runserver`


4. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
